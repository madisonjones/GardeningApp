JavaScript widgets, including the Pin It button.

Major release on 22-2-2016, including responsive grid and pin widgets, custom follow buttons, structure and CSS from templates, and SVG images made on the fly.  All legacy parameters -- including community-generated parameters such as data-pin-do="nothing" -- should still work; details to follow.
